Info/queries that will be needed in script process


Subsetting
    - get all hgts with a given CC
        - combine these hgts from two or more levels
        - get CCs for larger scheme/s
    - get STs that are assigned that CC in larger scheme/s
    - get alleles corresponding to those STs (as numbers and linked files) ** ONLY FOR THOSE LOCI THAT ARE NOT ALREADY CALLED
        - load sequeunces from linked files to compare

ST calling
    - if 0s in AP need to search for any exact matches ignoring those 0s
    - actually same for all AP searches as may match ST with no perfect ST
    - again needs search with a missmatch system / ability to ignore 0s

CC calling
    new ST = new allele profile
    - match allele profile against existing to get those with 1 difference (or more for ODCs) - need to have missmatch search
    2 options   - load APs into memory and commpare as strings/lists/dicts whatever
                -work out how to run a search with N missmatches allowed AND ignoring certain pairs.
